# Network-game
Project for "Przetwarzanie rozproszone" course
Description: 
  Simple network game based on agar.io, where player controls circle and "eats" smaller ones. To provide network connection,  we are planning to use network sockets C library (winsock). Game mechanics we will write using C++ classes, for graphics we will probably use WinAPI.
